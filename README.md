# Introduction

A collection of plugins used for the **Sales Configuration** Solution - **Sales Hub** Customization Applications.

# Getting Started

Once cloned, download all the missing packages for the solution and build the solution.

- Watch out for the directory name, it may cause some problems.

Use the **Plugin Registration Tool** in **XrmToolBox** to register the plugin and the plugin step.

- **Custom Action** might not be registered or displayed in the **Plugin Registration Tool**, you need to make sure the **Custom Action** is **activated** and **reload everything** from Power Platform to XrmToolBox.
- It's the same problem with the **Dataverse REST Builder**, you need to make sure the **Custom Action** is **activated** and **reload everything** from Power Platform to XrmToolBox.
